After over a decade together, _we’re finally getting hitched_. And where better to tie the knot than at a venue with a ropes course? That’s right, we’re keeping it weird and inviting you to celebrate with us for a whole weekend at **CAMP WEDDING**. (insert record scratch) Yep. We’re talking lake time, crafts, pinecones, color war. All of it. Plus a ceremony and some dancing thrown in for good measure.

Stay tuned for more info!
